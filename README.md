# Advent Of Code 2018

In this repo, I plan to gather my solutions for this year's Advent Of Code challenge. This challenge consists on a series of puzzles, two puzzles each day from Dec 1st to Dec 25th.

The first language that I will use to solve them will be C++. I plan to re-implement my solutions in other languages, some familiar some others new to me.
